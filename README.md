   Follow the official [guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) from the flutter team.

2. Run `flutter doctor`

    ```

    ```

    If all are ok, jump-in to the next step.

3. Go to the `dengue_app` folder

    ```
    cd dengue_app/
    ```

4. Install all the dependent flutter packages.  
   Run `flutter pub get` in the terminal, or click **Packages get** in IntelliJ or Android Studio.

    ```
    flutter pub get
    ```

5. Run the application.

## Flask Backend

![flask-setup](step-3.gif)

1. Install Python3

2. Go to `backend` folder

    ```
    cd backend/
    ```

3. If you're running the backend for the first time, run the `init.sh` script to install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. If not, skip to the 3rd step.

    ```
    sh init.sh
    ```

4. Start the flask server by running the `start.sh` script. This will run the `app.py` file. Flask server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default.
    ```
    sh start.sh
    ```

## React Admin Panel

    ```
    cd admin_panel/
    ```
